# Project DSA: Sorting Visualization
- This project is designed to learn and understand all sorting algorithms
- 2 version: website and application. Reason: built website ver. for better look and interactive.
- The project is designed based on Data Structure and Algorithms course

## I. Introduction
We chose sorting algorithms as the core factor for our project to revise what we have learnt in the theory classes and put the coding skills we have learnt in practice. The app was our first version, and then we decided to build a website for a better look.

## II. Techniques
- IDE for Website: HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- IDE for App: Java.

### 1. App version
- Here is the version of the project in app which is written by Java.

### 2. Website version
- Through this project, we aim to develop an educational tool that offers users a user-friendly, engaging, and personalized learning experience. This will be achieved through our fresh, eye-catching user interface inspired by astrology, and the introduction of new features. These features enable users to control how their inputs are sorted and how their data will be organized. On the website, we have included:
  + "Create Chart" button to create a new chart with random input.
  + "Sort" button to sort and visualize the charts.
  + A box "Speed" to choose the speed of the sort.
  + A box "Number" to select the number items in the chart.
  + a box "Description" to summarize the mechanic of the algorithm.
- After arranging:
  + Number of swaps: View the number of swaps in after sort.
  + Number Of Comparision: View the number of comparisons.
  + Total Comparision: View the number of total comparisons.
- Based on the use case scenario, the use case diagram is shown below:
